## 🔧 Changes Made

### 1. Updated .gitignore
**Before:** All media files (*.jpg, *.mp4, etc.) were globally excluded

**After:** Added exceptions for public folder:
```gitignore
# Exception: Allow media files in public folder for website
!public/**/*.jpg
!public/**/*.jpeg
!public/**/*.png
!public/**/*.gif
!public/**/*.svg
!public/**/*.webp
!public/**/*.ico
!public/**/*.mp4
!public/**/*.mov
```

### 2. Fixed productVariants.ts
**Issue:** `allVideos` field was missing from `createVariantFromProduct()` function

**Fix:** Added `allVideos` field to variant creation:
```typescript
allVideos: product.allVideos || [],
```

**Result:** Videos now properly passed from products.json → ProductVariant → VariantImageGallery

### 3. Added E2E Test Suite
**File:** `tests/e2e/product-gallery.test.ts`

**Tests included:**
- Gallery displays multiple images
- Navigation arrows work
- Clicking image changes main display
- Gallery handles products without images
- Videos display in gallery (with videos)
- Video filtering by metal type
- Play icon on video thumbnails
- Media counter shows correct count

## 🚀 Deployment Notes

### For Production Deployment

**Important:** This repository now contains ~2.9GB of media files. Consider:

1. **Git LFS (Large File Storage)** - Recommended for repos > 1GB
   ```bash
   # Install Git LFS
   git lfs install
   
   # Track media files
   git lfs track "public/**/*.mp4"
   git lfs track "public/**/*.jpg"
   
   # Migrate existing files to LFS
   git lfs migrate import --include="public/**/*.mp4,public/**/*.jpg"
   ```

2. **CDN Integration** - Consider moving media to CDN
   - Cloudinary
   - AWS S3 + CloudFront
   - Azure Blob Storage
   - Vercel Blob Storage

3. **Image Optimization**
   - Use Next.js Image Optimization
   - Convert to WebP format
   - Implement lazy loading
   - Add responsive images

4. **Video Optimization**
   - Compress videos (currently uncompressed)
   - Add video poster images
   - Implement streaming
   - Add multiple quality options
