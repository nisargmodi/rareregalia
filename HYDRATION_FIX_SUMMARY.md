# Hydration Error Fix

## Issue
React hydration error occurred when server-rendered HTML didn't match client-side rendering. This was specifically happening due to:

1. **Cart Store State**: The Zustand cart store with persistence was causing mismatches between server and client state
2. **Dynamic Content**: Components using `useEffect` and client-side state were rendering differently on server vs client

## Root Cause
- The cart store was trying to access localStorage during server-side rendering
- Header component was calling `getTotalItems()` before the client-side hydration was complete
- FeaturedProducts component had different loading states between server and client

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Cart Store Hydration
**File**: `src/store/cartStore.ts`
- Added `skipHydration: true` to the persist configuration
- This prevents the store from automatically hydrating during SSR

### 2. Fixed Header Component
**File**: `src/components/layout/Header.tsx`
- Added `isClient` state to track client-side rendering
- Added manual store rehydration trigger: `useCartStore.persist.rehydrate()`
- Only show cart count after client-side hydration is complete

```tsx
const [isClient, setIsClient] = useState(false);

useEffect(() => {
  setIsClient(true);
  // Manually trigger hydration for cart store
  useCartStore.persist.rehydrate();
}, []);

const cartItemCount = isClient ? getTotalItems() : 0;
```

### 3. Fixed FeaturedProducts Component
**File**: `src/components/home/FeaturedProducts.tsx`
- Added `isClient` state to ensure consistent server/client rendering
- Show loading state until client-side rendering is ready

```tsx
const [isClient, setIsClient] = useState(false);

useEffect(() => {
  setIsClient(true);
  // ... rest of effect
}, []);

// Show loading state on server and during initial client render
if (!isClient || loading) {
  // ... loading UI
}
```

## Result
âœ… **Hydration Error Resolved**
- No more "Unhandled Runtime Error" on page load
- Consistent rendering between server and client
- Cart functionality works properly after hydration
- Website loads without errors at http://localhost:3000

## Best Practices Applied
1. **Client-Side Guards**: Always check if component is client-side before accessing browser-specific APIs
2. **Manual Store Hydration**: Explicitly control when persistent stores hydrate
3. **Consistent Loading States**: Ensure server and client show the same initial content
4. **Skip Hydration**: Use `skipHydration: true` for stores that should only work client-side

The website now loads properly without hydration errors and all 897 products are accessible.
